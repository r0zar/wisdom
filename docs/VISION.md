# Vision for Wisdom SDK

## Purpose
Wisdom SDK serves as a solid backend infrastructure for prediction market applications, providing a seamless developer experience while demonstrating how Blaze can elevate web3 applications to web2-level UX quality.

## Core Principles
1. **Reliability** - Create a system that developers can trust with mission-critical operations
2. **Simplicity** - Provide intuitive APIs that are easy to understand and integrate
3. **Performance** - Optimize for speed and responsiveness expected in web2 applications
4. **Transparency** - Seamlessly abstract away blockchain complexity where appropriate
5. **Developer Experience** - Deliver complete TypeScript support and clear documentation

## Target Audience
- Developers building prediction market applications
- Teams looking for reference implementations of web3/web2 hybrid architectures
- Businesses aiming to provide web2-quality UX with web3 capabilities

## Long-term Vision
Serve as a practical proof-of-concept for how Blaze integration can transform web3 applications into experiences indistinguishable from traditional web2 applications in terms of speed and usability.
